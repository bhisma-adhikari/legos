- The java program uml2lejos.java converts a statechart file (generated by Star UML) 
  into a java file (CSE621.java).
- uml2jejos can be run right from the command line (no need to use IDE) with the 
  following command: (You may still use an IDE if you so wish).
- j1, j2 and j3 files are just copies of the three jackson jar files 



On a UNIX machine with java 11.x.x or newer:
    java -cp j1:j2:j3 uml2lejos.java SampleStatechart.mdj

On a Windows machine: (NOT TESTED)
    java -cp j1;j2;j3 uml2legos.java SampleStatechart.mdj 

NOTE: THE ABOVE COMPILATION APPROACH DID NOT WORK WHEN JAVA WAS DOWNGRADED TO 1.8.0 (FOR PAPYRUS-RT)

On a UNIX machine with java 1.8.0:
    javac -cp .:j1:j2:j3 uml2lejos.java                     
    java -cp .:j1:j2:j3 Main SampleStatechart.mdj 

On a Windows machine with java 1.8.0: (NOT TESTED)
    javac -cp .;j1;j2;j3 uml2lejos.java
    java -cp .;j1;j2;j3 Main SampleStatechart.mdj 

  

- This will generate a file called 'CSE621.java' in the current directory. 
- This will override any file named 'CSE621.java' in the current directory. 


DEPENDENCIES: 
- Make sure that the following 3 jars file are in the current directory:
    - jackson-annotations-2.8.4.jar
    - jackson-core-2.8.4.jar
    - jackson-databind-2.8.4.jar


- To run CSE621.java in a LEJOS EV3 hardware, follow these steps:  
    1. Create a LEJOS EV3 project in Eclipse IDE, with the following 
       directory structure:
        CSE621                          : project name 
        └── src                         : source directory 
            └── CSE621                  : package name 
                └── CSE621.java         : java class 
    2. Replace CSE621.java in the project with the one generated by uml2jejos. 
    3. From inside Eclipse IDE, run CSE621.java as 'LeJOS EV3 program'.
